Baven is intended to be a modular Maven-like utility for use in BASH scripts.

After growing tired of writing the same thing over and over and some prodding
by collegues at what a nerd I am, I decided to go for it.  If you have a
module you'd like to add, just let me (or whoever the project maintainer is)
know and after a quick code review it will very likely be accepted.
